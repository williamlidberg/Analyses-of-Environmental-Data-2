When presented with a problem take a minute to google what relevant python packages to use before you start writing everything from scratch. To install packages you use the command pip install. For example. To install pandas write pip install pandas in the terminal. If you are inside a jupyter notebook you can use the command ! infront of pip to show the notebook that it is a terminal command. If you run this in google colab you will get a number of \"Requirement already satisfied\" messenges. This means that pandas is already installed."
