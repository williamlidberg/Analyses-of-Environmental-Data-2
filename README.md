# Analyses-of-Environmental-Data-2

The course focuses on applying statistical models and machine learning methods to spatial data. The course is divided into several sections:
**1 Processing of spatial data with open software** 
**2 Programming in, for example, Python to analyze spatial data**
**3 Combining data from field studies with spatial data and statistical methods and machine learning** 
**4 Implementing machine learning models on spatial data**

After completing the course, the student should be able to:
*	Collect and prepare forest data from authorities such as the Swedish Forestry Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for analysis.
*	Independently perform spatial modeling of forest land based on remote sensing data.
*	Identify and classify differences and similarities between statistics and machine learning for ecological data.
*	Compare some traditional machine learning models based on accuracy and calculation speed.
*	Combine machine learning with geographic data to produce maps of biological conditions for sustainable forestry.
